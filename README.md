# Stock-reserch-filter
Stock Filtering Project
This project leverages Python to efficiently retrieve, analyze, and filter stock data from the SET market. By using a predefined list of stock symbols, the script connects to the yfinance service to fetch essential financial and market data. The core objective is to apply a set of predefined criteria to this data, identifying "interesting" stocks, and then saving the details of these qualifying stocks into an Excel file for easy review and further analysis.
## Main Objectives of the Project:
- Retrieve Stock Data: Connect to the yfinance service to fetch financial and market data for each stock.
- Filter Stocks: Apply predefined criteria to filter for interesting stocks.
- Save Results: Store the data of the filtered stocks into an Excel file for further analysis.
  
Technologies Used: Python, yfinance, pandas, openpyxl
